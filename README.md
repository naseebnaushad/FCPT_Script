# fcpt_script
It is a shell script to reset the trial period counter for Final Cut Pro Trial version.

You need to install Final Cut Pro Trial version from Apple's website before running this script.

After installing Final Cut Pro Trial, it is highly recommended to either download the release app(which is just an automator app to execute the script) or create an automator app yourself to run the script and open the app, that way you don't have to run the script and open the app one by one.
